  Build a file-based, multilingual blog from markdown content: locale-partitioned
  posts, per-locale slugs joined by a shared translation key, tag pages, related
  posts, cover art, RSS, sitemap and hreflang. Use when: (1) adding a blog,
  changelog, news or article section backed by markdown files rather than a CMS,
  (2) making an existing markdown blog multilingual, or adding tag pages,
  hreflang, feeds or related posts, (3) the content lives in a repo folder and
  must be statically generated, (4) the user mentions: markdown blog, MDX blog,
  frontmatter, gray-matter, content/blog, translationKey, tag pages, hreflang,
  related posts, generateStaticParams for posts, blog RSS feed. Carries the
  cross-locale slug model, the tag-slug collision rule, the frontmatter parser
  that survives smart quotes, and the loader memoization that removes a measured
  71x build-time read amplification. Next.js App Router oriented; the content
  source is a seam, so a CMS can replace the filesystem. Not a CMS integration
  skill and not a docs/help-center skill.

# Markdown Blog (multilingual, tagged)

A blog where the content is files, not rows. The whole design turns on one idea:
**a post's identity is its `translationKey`, not its slug.** Slugs are localized
for SEO and differ per language; the key is what makes three files one article,
and it is what powers hreflang, the language switcher, related posts, and
cross-locale redirects. Get that one field right and everything else is lookups.

Written by the engineer who has shipped this module. The earlier implementation
it was audited against was a multi-locale, statically generated marketing blog
with its sitemap and SEO surface. The facts and rules below are what the
content-layer suite and the build verify; `references/provenance.md` has the
record.

## When to use

- Content authored as markdown in the repo, deployed with the app
- More than one language, with different slugs per language
- Tag pages, related posts, feeds, or hreflang are in scope
- You want the whole thing statically generated at build time

## When NOT to use

| Instead of this | Use |
|---|---|
| A hosted CMS is the source of truth | that CMS's SDK; keep only `references/content-model.md` |
| A docs site / help center (categories, sidebar, search) | a help-center skill, a different navigation model |
| A single-locale blog of <10 posts | plain `fs` + `gray-matter` inline; this is overhead |
| Rendering user-submitted markdown | a sanitizing renderer; see the XSS note in `references/rendering.md` |

## Architecture

```
content/blog/<locale>/<localized-slug>.md   # frontmatter + body
        |
        v
 parseFrontmatter  --YAML, falls back to a line parser on malformed quotes
        |
        v
   getAllPosts(locale)  <-- memoized per locale in production
        |
        +--> translationKey ----> alternates / hreflang / language switch
        +--> tags -> tag SLUG ---> tag pages (slug is the identity, not the label)
        +--> related (EN slugs) -> related posts, with an EN fallback
        |
        v
  /blog   /blog/[slug]   /blog/tag/[slug]   sitemap.xml   feed.xml
```

## Critical facts

1. **Relations are authored once, in the default locale, as default-locale
   slugs.** A translated file may omit `related` entirely and still get the right
   related posts, resolved through `translationKey`, so every translation
   renders the same related section. The fallback test holds it.
2. **A tag's identity is its slug, not its label.** `"AI Agents"` and
   `"AI agents"` slug to the same URL. Group by slug and match posts by slug, so
   every spelling variant's posts appear on the one tag page. Two tests hold it.
3. **`gray-matter` throws on a double-quoted YAML scalar containing raw quote
   characters**: typographic quotes in a translated excerpt do it. Without a
   fallback parser the build stops on that one file; the line-by-line fallback
   keeps it loading. Verified against the library and covered by a test.
4. **`gray-matter` caches a failed parse as an empty result.** It writes its
   cache entry before parsing, so the second and every later parse of a file
   that threw returns `{}`, with no error and no frontmatter. Always call
   `matter(contents, {})`; any options object opts out of the cache.
5. **Loading is O(posts x locales) per page unless you memoize.** Memoize per
   locale so each content file is read once per build; resolving alternates in
   `generateMetadata` is otherwise a 71x file-read amplification, measured on
   the earlier implementation.
6. **`getPostSlugs` must filter `.md`.** The filter keeps a stray `.DS_Store`
   from becoming a `.DS_Store.md` read and an `ENOENT`. A test holds it.
7. **Tag pages have no cross-locale identity.** Tags are per-locale free text, so
   the language switcher must fall back to the blog index on a tag URL rather
   than build a URL that 404s.

## Hard rules

> **Never key cross-locale lookups on the slug.** Slugs are localized on purpose.
> `translationKey` is the join column; a slug match across locales is a
> coincidence, not a relation.

> **Never let `getPostBySlug` decide draft visibility implicitly.** Filter
> drafts in the loader; `dynamicParams = false` hides them only as a side effect
> and stops doing so the moment the flag changes. The draft test holds the
> filter.

> **Never render a "5 min read" constant.** Compute it from the body; it costs
> one `split`, and the reading-time test holds it.

> **Never derive a tag page's URL from the label at read time and the label from
> the URL at render time without a collision check.** That round trip is only
> lossless while every label slugs uniquely.

## Quick start

1. Set the locale contract and the frontmatter schema:
   [content-model.md](references/content-model.md)
2. Build the loader (memoized, `.md`-filtered, fallback parser):
   [content-loader.md](references/content-loader.md)
3. Wire locales, alternates and cross-locale redirects:
   [i18n-and-routing.md](references/i18n-and-routing.md)
4. Add tag grouping and tag pages: [tags.md](references/tags.md)
5. Build the three routes, metadata and JSON-LD:
   [pages-and-seo.md](references/pages-and-seo.md)
6. Render bodies and covers: [rendering.md](references/rendering.md)
7. Add the validation script and read the operator gaps:
   [operations.md](references/operations.md)
8. Run the fixtures and tests: [testing.md](references/testing.md)

Porting this into an existing app? Fill in the seam table in
[adaptation.md](references/adaptation.md) first; it takes ten minutes and saves
a rename.
